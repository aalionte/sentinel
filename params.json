{"name":"Sentinel","tagline":"distributed systems, real-time data stream mining, stream mining, data stream, big data stream, ","body":"**Sentinel** is project written in Java to perform real-time stream mining on Twitter Public Stream using [SAMOA](http://samoa-project.net/) and [Apache Storm](https://storm.incubator.apache.org/). Sentinel is a distributed system that aims to use new distributed algorithms. Currently Sentinel only performs real-time distributed system. See ```Tasks``` section for details on how to work with Sentinel.\r\n \r\n\r\n##Components\r\n### Twitter Stream Instance \r\nThis component implements SAMOA's InstanceStreamClass  which gets stream from ```StreamAPIReader``` and performs sketching, filtering and etc.\r\n\r\n### Twitter Stream API Reader\r\nThis components connects to Twitter Public Stream API and reads instances and keeps the instances in an adaptive sliding window.\r\n\r\n### Model\r\nRepresents an MVC style model, set of core attributes, setters and getters.\r\n\r\n### Processors\r\nProcessors perform text normalization to Tweets such as removing emoticons, URLs and Twitter Specific Characters.\r\n\r\n### Sketch\r\nSketching algorithms such as SpaceSavings keep a summary of the text in-memory so that real-time stream mining could become possible. Also, they enable online approaches to data stream mining which are more adaptive than hold-out approaches, e.g. batch analysis of stream data.\r\n\r\n### Feature Reducer\r\nThis components transforms tweet texts into an sparse feature vectors and only keeps frequent features in memory only. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Language Detector\r\nThis component uses the classification approach for detecting language of a tweet according to [Language Detection Library for Java](https://code.google.com/p/language-detection/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nSentinel is a module of a bigger project. In order to use Sentinel, you need to run it with Apache Storm and SAMOA. Read the information at [https://github.com/ambodi/samoa](https://github.com/ambodi/samoa).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install\r\nClone [SAMOA fork for Sentinel](https://github.com/ambodi/samoa)\r\nClone [Sentinel]\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ambodi/samoa\r\n```\r\n\r\nClone [Sentinel]\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/ambodi/sentinel\r\n```\r\nPut Sentinel under \r\n```\r\nsamoa-api/src/main/java/com/yahoo/labs/samoa/sentinel\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdd ```twitter4j.properties``` file in the root of the project. More info at [Twitter 4J's Documentation on Generic properties](http://twitter4j.org/en/configuration.html \"Title\")\r\n\r\n## Build\r\n\r\n```\r\nmvn clean install\r\n```\r\n\r\nLocal Cluster: \r\n```\r\nmvn package \r\n```\r\n\r\nApache Storm Cluster:\r\n```\r\nmvn -Pstorm package\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tasks\r\n\r\n### Real-time Sentiment Analysis on Twitter Public Stream \r\n#### Run via Bash\r\nUsing Vertical Hoeffding Tree as a distributed parallel classification algorithm, you can perform sentiment analysis on [Twitter Public Stream](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/streaming-apis/streams/public) with Prequential Evaluation Task. \r\n\r\nTo perform sentiment analysis on a sample of 100000 tweets in real-time with 4 parallel nodes in your local cluster, run\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/samoa local target/SAMOA-Local-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \"PrequentialEvaluation -d /tmp/dump.csv -i 1000000 -f 100000 -l (classifiers.trees.VerticalHoeffdingTree -p 4) -s com.yahoo.labs.samoa.sentinel.model.TwitterStreamInstance\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr if you run it in Apache Storm, run\r\n\r\n```\r\nbin/samoa storm target/SAMOA-Storm-0.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \"PrequentialEvaluation -d /tmp/dump.csv -i 1000000 -f 100000 -l (classifiers.trees.VerticalHoeffdingTree -p 4) -s com.yahoo.labs.samoa.sentinel.model.TwitterStreamInstance\"\r\n```\r\n### Configuration by Code\r\nPut the following code under ```samoa-local(samoa-storm)/src/main/java/com/yahoo/labs/samoa/```:\r\n\r\n    public static void main( String[] args ) {\r\n        PrequentialEvaluation pe = new PrequentialEvaluation();\r\n        pe.setFactory(new SimpleComponentFactory());\r\n\r\n        pe.dumpFileOption.setValueViaCLIString(\"/tmp/dump.csv\");\r\n        pe.instanceLimitOption.setValue(50);\r\n        pe.sampleFrequencyOption.setValue(5);\r\n        pe.learnerOption.setValueViaCLIString(\"classifiers.trees.VerticalHoeffdingTree -p 1\");\r\n        pe.streamTrainOption.setValueViaCLIString(TwitterStreamInstance.class.getName());\r\n\r\n        pe.init();\r\n    }\r\n\r\nRun ```mvn -X exec:java -Dexec.mainClass=com.yahoo.labs.samoa.app```\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is preferred if you are developing and want to make use of debug mode.  \r\n<!--\r\n  Copyright (c) 2013 Yahoo!
